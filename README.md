# Individually Addressable LEDs

Example code using FreeRTOS to control individually addressable LEDs (SK6812).  This project also experiments with the DSP onboard the STM32F4-Discovery via audio syncing.

## Architecture

The idea is to use 2 different tasks to manage the LEDS. The tasks are listed below by priority (higher numbers will preempt lower numbers).

0.  Idle Task
    -  Does nothing
1.  Pattern Task
    - Decides what pattern to show
    - Calculates RGB color based on selected pattern
    - 10ms (100 Hz)
2.  Refresh Task
    - Refreshes the actual colors shown on the LED strip
        - Initiates PWM pulse train
    - 10ms (100 Hz)

## Peripherals

#### Timers

```
Timer 4: LED Data Line
Timer 12: 44.1 kHz timer for sampling audio data 
```

#### GPIO:

```
C4: Audio voltage data
B6: LED Data
D12: LED4 (GRN) - Indicates stack overflow for vCreatePattern
D13: LED3 (ORG) - Indicates stack overflow for vUpdateLedStrip
D14: LED5 (RED) - Indicates ADC conversion took longer than desired (44.1 kHz) sample time.
D15: LED6 (BLU)
```

#### DMA:
```
DMA1 Stream 0: Transfer duty cycles to PWM module.
```

#### ADC's:
```
ADC1 Channel 12: Samples audio voltage data
```

## Future Work

1.  Update ADC sampling to use DMA

## Notes
Use `xTaskCreateStatic` to create a task with the stack in a static location

Use `xTaskCreate` to create a task with the stack in a dynamic location

Use `vTaskDelayUntil` to schedule task to be run again

Use `uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark` to see the highest of stack usage

Use `taskENTER_CRITICAL` to disable interrupts and tasks

Use `taskEXIT_CRITICAL` to re-enable interrupts and tasks

Use `portTICK_PERIOD_MS` to determine period of one clock tick/cycle
